visualizing medical test conditional probabilities

inspired by Stephen Strogatz's NYT conditional probability post http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/chances-are/?_r=0

Some ideas to pursue:

Making this generalized sensitivity/specificity, with the Strogatz puzzle just one example of a particular disease + diagnostic.

Perhaps we can tie in some public health api for prevalance and diagnostic exam sensitivity/specificity

Would love a color scheme that imparts some sort of meaning, and some intuitive way of visualizing probabilities across rows or columns (maybe on mouseover)
